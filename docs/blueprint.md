## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 77%, 50% (equivalent to RGB hex #3898F1). A classic, confident blue conveying trust, perfect for file sharing and security, with a modern edge that pairs well with a light or dark theme.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (equivalent to RGB hex #F0F4F8). A desaturated tint of the primary blue, for a calm background that harmonizes well with the other design elements.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 65%, 45% (equivalent to RGB hex #2BBAB4). A contrasting, complementary teal to signal availability, indicate active processes, and attract attention to important links/buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, neutral, and modern look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent file types, actions (upload, delete, share), and status indicators.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with clear visual hierarchy, prioritizing ease of use for file upload and management.
- Subtle animations for upload progress and UI transitions to enhance user engagement.
